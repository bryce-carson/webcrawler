# Dura Gra-Bol's house should be player owned
When the player kills an outlaw they fairly own all of their property. Dura Gra-Bol's real property (her house) should be included in that, and should be renamed to indicate that the Player fairly gained the property by killing an outlaw. How Dura Gra-Bol managaged to purchase property in a Hlaalu city is up to the user to imagine, but Hlaalu are fairly well known for their love of septims.
